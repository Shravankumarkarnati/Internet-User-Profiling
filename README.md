# Internet-User-Profiling
***

In this project, we want to demonstrate if the Internet usage of
each subject is statistically indistinguishable when compared to the Internet usage of the same
subject over time, while simultaneously being statistically distinguishable when compared to
Internet usage of other subjects. Subsequently, we want to study how the time window chosen for
profiling affects the answer to the above problem.
